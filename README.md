## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

A simple site made with only HTML and CSS. Highlights (in every sense of the word) what can be accomplished with simple markup language and fun graphics. 

## Lessons Learned:

If you're going to rely primarily on images for your theming and communication, make sure to account for the time you'll need in order to find cohesive images.
